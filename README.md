# ðŸŒ³ Canopy Height Accuracy Assessment


This project provides a script to evaluate the accuracy of canopy height predictions against a reference dataset, using ETH Zurichâ€™s Global Canopy Height Map as ground truth data. Key metrics, such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Pearson Correlation, and Accuracy Percentage, are calculated to assess the quality of the predictions.

## Project Overview

Accurate canopy height mapping is vital for ecological studies, forest management, and carbon stock estimation. This project assesses the accuracy of canopy height model predictions by comparing them to a high-resolution reference dataset, providing error metrics that help quantify the modelâ€™s performance.

### Objective
Accurate canopy height predictions are essential for analyzing forest structure and biomass, contributing to climate change studies and conservation strategies. This project provides a structured, reproducible framework for assessing the accuracy of canopy height predictions. The results include detailed statistical and error metrics, highlighting areas where canopy height models perform well and where improvements are needed.


## Dataset

In this project, canopy height was predicted using a machine learning model trained on various remote sensing datasets. The model enhances prediction accuracy by leveraging features from satellite imagery. The comparison of the predicted canopy heights against the ETH Zurich dataset allows for a thorough assessment of the model's performance and effectiveness in estimating canopy heights.

## Metrics Explanation
To quantify prediction accuracy, the following metrics are calculated:

1. **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: Measures the average error magnitude without regard to direction, providing a straightforward interpretation of error magnitude. Smaller MAE indicates a closer match to the reference.

   *Formula:*  
   \[
   \text{MAE} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} | \text{predicted}_i - \text{reference}_i |
   \]

2. **Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)**: Provides a more sensitive error measurement than MAE by penalizing larger errors, giving insights into significant deviations between predicted and reference values.

   *Formula:*  
   \[
   \text{RMSE} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (\text{predicted}_i - \text{reference}_i)^2}
   \]

3. **Pearson Correlation Coefficient (r)**: Assesses the linear relationship between predictions and the reference data. Higher correlation values (closer to Â±1) indicate stronger alignment with the reference data trends.

   *Formula:*  
   \[
   r = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \bar{x})(y_i - \bar{y})}{\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \bar{x})^2} \cdot \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \bar{y})^2}}
   \]

4. **Accuracy Percentage**: Expresses prediction accuracy relative to the reference dataset as a percentage, where higher values indicate closer alignment.

   *Formula:*  
   \[
   \text{Accuracy Percentage} = 100 - \left(\frac{\text{MAE}}{\text{Mean of Reference Values}} \times 100\right)
   \]

These metrics collectively offer a robust assessment of the model's predictive performance, helping to refine canopy height models for environmental applications.
